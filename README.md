# Interceptor

**Project Description:**
Interceptor is a 2D top-down game inspired by the classic arcade game Spy Hunter, with a Mad Max theme. This project is designed to help me learn GitHub and improve my coding skills. The unique challenge is that I will be developing this game primarily on my iPhone using available tools and platforms.

## Objectives
1. Learn the basics of GitHub, including version control, repositories, and collaboration.
2. Improve my coding skills by creating a simple yet engaging game.
3. Adapt to mobile coding and development, using my iPhone as the main device for this project.

## Features
- **Mad Max Theme:** Post-apocalyptic visual style with rugged terrains and vehicles.
- **Player Car:** Control a car equipped with weapons to navigate and survive the wasteland.
- **Enemies:** Various enemy vehicles and obstacles inspired by the Mad Max universe.
- **Weapons and Power-ups:** Collect power-ups and use weapons to eliminate enemies.
- **Scoring System:** Earn points for defeating enemies and surviving longer.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Game Development Library:** Pygame
- **Development Platform:** GitHub and CodeSandBox on iPhone

## Repository Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the game.
  - `main.py`: The main script for the game.
- **assets/**: Contains game assets like images and sounds.
  - `placeholder.txt`: A placeholder file for the assets directory.
- **README.md**: This file, describing the project and its objectives.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
3. Navigate to the `src/` directory and run `main.py`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Interceptor.git
cd Interceptor/src
python main.py
```

## Learning Journey

This project is a personal journey to understand the intricacies of game development and GitHub. By working on this game, I aim to gain practical experience in coding, version control, and mobile development.
